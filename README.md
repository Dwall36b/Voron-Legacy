# Voron-Legacy
Bits and pieces for my Voron Legacy build

Files have been taking from different sources, I have used them in my build and just posted them here for my ease of tracking them down again.
  File sources are as follows: Steve Builds, Voron mods, printables.com, Chirpy, and other voron sources.
